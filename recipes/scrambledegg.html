        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scrambled eggs are probably one of the easiest breakfasts you can make, yet everyone has a different way of making them. 
            And while many of us probably follow the scrambled egg recipe that our parents or grandparents taught us, 
            there are so many delicious methods out there that we might be missing out on.</p>
        <p>You make the eggs in a saucepan and keep removing them from the heat while stirring constantly.
            Although cooking the eggs didn't take the entire 3 minutes that Gordon suggests, 
            it did work wonders to create fluffy eggs. Plus, the crème fraîche touch at the end adds a nice tangy flavor and creamy texture.</p>
