            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/2 (12 ounce) jar ube yam spread</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ube extract (such as McCormickÂ®) (Optional)</li>
            <li>2/3cup macapuno (preserved young coconut strings)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon muscovado sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup muscovado sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons toasted flaked coconut (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch baking pan with banana leaves or parchment paper and coat with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk rice flours, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, then stir in the water and coconut milk. Add ube spread and ube extract. Fold in macapuno and 1 tablespoon muscovado. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top starts to crack and leaves turn brown, about 35 minutes. Brush top with 1 tablespoon butter, then bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 20 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1/4 cup muscovado sugar; cook, stirring, until it starts to boil. Remove from heat and pour over warm mochi, covering evenly. Sprinkle with toasted coconut. Let cool, at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use banana leaves to lift mochi out of the pan. Cut into 25 small squares; cut squares diagonally into triangles.</li>

        </ol>
